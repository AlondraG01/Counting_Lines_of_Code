# Counting_Lines_of_Code

Application Description
Write a program to analyze a Java code file, specifically counting the Lines of Code (LOC).

Design/Features
•	You must use the Java programming language to develop this program.
•	Allow the user to choose an input Java code file.
•	Count and report all lines of code in the file. 
  Ignore blank lines (those containing only white space). 
  Ignore comment lines as well. 
  Remember that comments may start with /* and end with */ several lines below
•	Develop a plan and design for your program. 
  Choose the best possible data structures.
•	The final report must also list the names of all methods in the source file along with their number of lines.
•	Produce a table listing of control structures used in the code file.  
  For example, indicate how many for loops, while loops, if statements, etc. are used in the code.
•	Use OOP and write efficient code. For example, do not unnecessarily traverse the list. 
•	Assure the readability of your code in this assignment. 

Testing
1.	Test for basic functionality. Run the program on multiple code files.
2.	Test for simple comments (// or /*..*/ on one line). NOTE: * // or /* or */ inside of quotes should not be counted as comments.
3.	Test for empty lines
4.	Test for multi-line comments
